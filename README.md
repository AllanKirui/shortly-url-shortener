I tackled a challenge offered by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to get some practice with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Built with :hammer_and_wrench: :pencil: :triangular_ruler:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) - A rugged, minimal framework for composing behavior directly in your markup
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - A free and open-source vector graphics editor

<br/>

### What I learned 🎓

Working on a larger Tailwind project offered me a great chance to enhance my skills in [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I also got the chance to work with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and found using the framework to implement functionalities on the website quite enjoyable 🤓

- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) - Build websites even faster with components on top of Tailwind CSS

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape SVG Editor. I use it all the time when I'm working on any web project. After _accepting the challenge_ by Frontend Mentor, I loaded up the design files inside Inkscape and used it's in-built tools to help me figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project. To better understand how I approached coding the project using Inkscape, have a look at this repository I made - [Designing and Coding Layouts](https://github.com/AllanKirui/designing-and-coding-layouts)
